      <t>
This specification supports the separation of the Control-Plane for mobility- and session
management from the Data-Plane. The protocol semantics abstract the configuration of
Data-Plane nodes and applies it between a Client function, which is used by an application
of the mobility Control-Plane, and an Agent function, which is associated with the configuration
of Data-Plane nodes, according to the Data-Plane rules issued by the mobility Control-Plane.
The scope of the rules comprises traffic description and treatment of packets in terms of
encapsulation, IP address re-writing and QoS. Additional protocol semantics are described to
support the maintenance of the Data-Plane path.

    <section title="Introduction">


<t>
One objective of the Distributed Mobility Management (DMM) WG is the separation of
the mobility management Control- and Data-Plane to enable flexible deployment, such
as decentralized provisioning of Data-Plane nodes (DPN). Data-Plane nodes can be configured
to function as an anchor for a registered Mobile Node's (MN) traffic, others can be configured
to function as a Mobile Access Gateway (MAG) per the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol
<xref target="RFC5213"></xref> or a Foreign Agent (FA) per the Mobile IPv4 protocol
<xref target="RFC3344"></xref>. Requirements for DMM have been described in <xref target="RFC7333"></xref>,
whereas best current practices for DMM are documented in <xref target="RFC7429"></xref>.
</t>

<t>
The Data-Plane must provide a set of functions to the Mobility Control-Plane, such as
support for encapsulation, IP address re-writing, QoS differentiation and traffic shaping.
In addition, means for traffic description must be provided to complement traffic treatment actions
and build unambiguous Data-plane rules. These requirements are met by various transport network components,
such as IP switches and routers, though configuration semantics differ between them.
</t>

<t>Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC) per this document enables the configuration
of any Data-Plane node and type by the abstraction of configuration details and the use
of common configuration semantics. The protocol using the FPC semantics is deployed between
a Client function, which is associated with the Mobility Management Control-Plane,
and an Agent function. The Agent function enforces the Data-Plane configuration
and can be present on a transport network controller or co-located with a Data-Plane
node. The Agent applies the generalized configuration semantics to configuration, which
is specific to the Data-Plane node and type.
</t>

<t>This specification follows a common functional architecture, which utilizes the FPC
protocol between the Client and Agent functions.</t>

<t>A Client interacts with the Agent to build unambiguous rules which are to be enforced in
the Data-Plane. An Agent translates a rule, which follows the data model herein, into one or
multiple configuration actions to enforce the rule in the Data-Plane. Distinct collections of
rulese are defined as Ports in the information Model.</t>

<t>The Client interacts with the Agent to build sessions, including mobility sessions, to be
hosted by teh Data-Plane.  These sessions are referred to as Contexts.
</t>

<t>A Client utilizes a sequence or grouping of control messages to interact with the Agent, where
each control message has an unambiguous semantic, e.g. to set up a tunnel interface or to
configure a policy route in a Data-Plane node. An Agent performs a configuration action
per the semantics of the received control message or grouping of control messages. Generic messages,
i.e. create, update, query and delete, are also supported.</t>

<t>The availability of both generic and control messaging enables tailored implementation and deployment of Control-/Data-Plane
separation in mobile communication gateways, e.g. by having the Mobility Control-Plane directly communicating to
a Data-Plane node using control messages, or by the deployment of a Network Controller in between the Mobility
Control-Plane and Data-Plane nodes which may support both generic and control messages, which are under control of the Network Controller. Support for multiple deployment models
enables an operator to transition their network in incremental phases.</t>

<t>The architecture and reference interface specified in this document is not tied to any specific Control-Plane
protocol that is in use in the mobility network, or to any type of access technology. The mobility protocols in
use can be Proxy Mobile IPv6, GTP, IPSec or other protocols; and the access network can be 4G LTE, WiFi, or 5G.
These aspects have no direct implication on the FPC interface that is between Control- and Data-Plane nodes.</t>

<t>The DMM Forwarding Policy Configuration (FPC) protocol enables the separation of the mobility management Control-Plane
from the Data-Plane and provides the required control and semantics in between these two planes.
<xref target="fig_usecase"></xref> depicts an exemplary use case where IP traffic between a Correspondent Node (CN)
and a Mobile Node (MN) traverses multiple DPNs, each applying policies as per the Control-Plane's request.
Policies in the one or multiple DPNs can result in traffic steering according to a host-route, packet scheduling
and marking according to a subscriber's QoS profile, or forwarding rules (e.g. encapsulation within GRE or GTP-U tunnel).

<t>Mobility Control-Plane functions have the following roles in common: </t>

 <t><list style="symbols">
     <t>Tracking a mobile node's attachment, detachment from the access network.</t>
     <t>Accept requests to set up and maintain mobility-related Data-Plane paths between DPNs,
        enforcing QoS and forwarding policies. Such requests are a result of mobility signaling between different
        Mobility Control-Plane functions.</t>
     <t>Ensure that required rules to establish and maintain connectivity of an MN with its correspondent
        nodes are enforced in the Data-Plane.</t>
     <t>Participate in monitoring the DPNs' operation and support the handling of exceptions, e.g. the
        detection of a partial DPN failure and the diversion of traffic through a different DPN.</t>
     <t>Maintain consistency between multiple DPNs which enforce policy rules to ensure
        connectivity between a MN and its correspondent services.</t>
  </list></t>

<t>Mobility Data-Plane functions have the following roles in common: </t>

  <t><list style="symbols">
     <t>Forward and treat traffic according to the policies and directives sent by the Mobility Control-Plane.</t>
     <t>Provide status information (e.g. load, health, statistics and traffic volume) and events related to service failure
        upon request.</t>
     <t>Participate in the process of topology acquisition, e.g. by exposing relevant topological and
        capability information, such as support for QoS differentiation and supported encapsulation protocols.
        </t>
  </list></t>
<t>The protocol for DMM FPC applies to the interface between a FPC Client function and
a FPC Agent function, as depicted in <xref target="fig_refarch"></xref>. The FPC Client function
is associated with an application function of the mobility management Control-Plane, e.g. a Local
Mobility Anchor Control-Plane function per the Proxy Mobile IPv6 protocol.
The FPC Agent function processes the FPC protocol semantics and translates them into configuration
commands per the DPN's technology. In one example, a FPC Agent can be co-located with a Network
Controller, which enforces forwarding rules on a set of Data-plane nodes. In another example, the Agent
can be co-located with a Data-Plane node to directly interact with interface management and the
router's RIB Manager. The mapping of the common FPC semantics and policy description to the configuration
commands of a particular DPN is specific to the DPN's technology and the Agent's implementation.

<section anchor="model1" title="Information Model">
    <t>To abstract from configuration details of an IP switch or IP router on the FPC protocol interface,
    the construct of logical ports describe sets of rules for D-Plane processing and contexts describe
    Session/Mobility based rules and congfiguration.
    </t>
    <t>A conext binds one or multiple session/mobility properties, which describe mobliity/session traffic
    treatment actions, such as a mobility QoS policy or packet encapsulation. Which traffic is treated by the
    context is determined by one or multiple traffic descriptors, which also bind to that context. A group of
    one or multiple traffic descriptors, one or multiple properties defining mobility/session based traffic
    treatment actions and the port identifier make a context. The context identifier serves as key to access
    the information.</t>
    <t>A port represents a colleciton of policy groups, a group of rules that can exists independent of the
    mobility/session lifecycle.  Policy groups are named collections of policies.  Policy groups provide a
    collection of policies, e.g. a contatenation of the rules in each policy, to provide a second level of
    rule aggregation often required to separate out technical grouping of rules, e.g. a policy, with the
    grouping of rules for use cases, e.g. a service level policy.
    </t>
    <t>Policies are a collection of rules.  A policy's rules contain traffic descriptors that describe the traffic
    to which a rule applies and associated treatment actions.  The rules are ordered to ensure an unambiguous
    traffic matching.
    </t>
    <t>Actions, descriptors, policies and policy groups can be viewed as configuration data while ports and contexts
    are akin to stuctures that are instantiatied on the DPN.  The descriptors, QoS attributes, actions and other
    structures referenced by a port or context are active, i.e. they can be applied to traffic on a DPN.
    The other structures are passive and MUST be present on a DPN but MUST also be referenced by a context or
    port in order to participate in traffic processing.
    </t>
    <t>All traffic arriving at a Data-Plane node and matching a traffic descriptor will be treated per
    the properties bound to the port or context the traffic descriptor is also bound to. For example, Traffic
    Selectors <xref target="RFC6088"></xref>, which can be bound to a context or port, can identify single or
    multiple IP flows. Aggregated IP traffic destined toward a given IP address prefix or originated from
    an address matching a particular IP address range can be described using the Traffic Selector or an IP prefix
    traffic descriptor per this specification.</t>
  <section anchor="naming" title="Naming">
    <t>Names have no official format between the Client and Agent but using unsigned 32 bit integers MUST be supported
      by Clients and Agents.  Other formats such as strings or URIs MAY be supported. The only requirement is that all
      names used to identify entities must be unique by Client/Agent pair for each entity type, e.g. Context, Port, etc.
      This is done by using binary comparison of names at the Agent. If a creation attempt occurs for an entity where the
      name already exists a NAME_ALREADY_EXISTS error is raised.
    </t>
    <t>The naming convention can be used to accommodate heirarchical structures such as virtual routing and fowarding (VRF),
      Policy Based Routing (PBR), Tunnel Interfaces, Networks, etc.  For example using a string prefix such as "mcc:01/mnc:002",
      an inteface such as "/if:1/", a VRF route, e.g. "/vrf:xxx/routeid:001" or a service id in a network
      "mcc:01/mnc:002/sr-id:internet".
    </t>
  </section>
  <section anchor="policy" title="Policies, Actions and Descriptors">
    <t>Actions specify the treatment applied to a packet. Actions are assigned an identifier and contain a type and value.</t>
    <t>Descriptor describes a filter for a packet. If the packet matches (passes) the filter it is said to be consumed by
      or taken by the Descriptor. Many specifications also used the terms Filter, Traffic Descriptor or Traffic Selector
      <xref target="RFC6088"/>. A packet that meets the criteria of a Descriptor is said to satisfy, pass or is consumed by
      the Descriptor. Descriptors are assigned an identifier and contain a type and value.</t>
    <t>Rules - are a collection of Descriptors and Actions. All Descriptors MUST be satisfied before the Actions are taken.
      This is known as an AND Descriptor list, i.e. Descriptor 1 AND Descriptor 2 AND ... Descriptor X MUST be satisfied for
      the rule to apply. These are an internal to the Policy, i.e. it is not a first class, visible object at the top level
      of an agent. Each Action and Descriptor are given Identifiers to assist in deleting individual list members of the Rule.
      Every Action also comes with an order value that specifies the execution order of Actions and simplifies DPN
      processing. A Rule references the Descriptors and Actions by their Identifiers and does not directly contain Action
      and Descriptor structures.</t>
    <t>Policies are a collection of Rules. Each Policy has a Policy Identifier and a list of Rules/Order pairs. Unlike the
      AND filter matching the Policy uses an OR matching to find the first Rule whose Descriptors are satisfied by the packet.
      The search for a Rule to apply to packet is executed according to the Order values of the Rules. This is an
      ascending order search, i.e. the Rule with the lowest Order value is tested first and if its Descriptors are not
      satisfied by the packet the Rule with the next lowest Order value is tested. Policies contain Rules as opposed to
      references to Rules.</t>
    <t>Policy Groups are an aggregation of Policies and provide a convenience mechanism for aggregation. Common applications
      include aggregating Policies that are defined by different functions, e.g. Network Address Translation, Security, etc.
      The structure has an Identifier and references the Policies via their Identifiers.</t>
  </section>
  <section anchor="portscontext" title="Ports and Context">
    <t>Ports contain Policy Groups (via reference to their Policy Group Identifiers) and have an Identifier. They may be
      instantiated on the DPN at the discretion of the Agent. Being Policy based and having the ability to specify Rules
      with Forwarding related Actions, Ports can take on functions such as network address translation, route selection, etc.</t>
    <t>Contexts provide Port functionality with a focus on hierarchically related forwarding functions such as Mobility.
      They have attributes such as uplink/downlink Quality of Service (QoS) and tunnel and assigned IP, e.g. delegating
      prefixes, as well as the ability to reference parent Contexts. When a parent Context is referenced, the descendant,
      e.g. child, can inherit required properties and policies. Contexts also have fate sharing - when a Context is deleted
      all of its descendants are deleted. They are also assigned Data Plane Nodes (DPNs).
    </t>
    <t>Although Contexts are hierarchical Ports are not. There are distinct advantages in Contexts for the hierarchical
      representation including limiting the amount of over the wire information transported and fate sharing during deletion.
      However, Client MUST avoid creating deep, arbitrary hierarchies as this creates major disadvantages. A two tier
      hierarchy is common in many mobility solutions but further depths SHOULD be avoided.</t>
  </section>
  <section anchor="toplogy" title="Topology">
    <t>Data Plane Nodes may be organized into Data Plane Groups. A Context is attached to a DPN Group indirectly (by
      reference to the DPN Group Identifier) or directly through specification of the structure in the Context.</t>
    <t>A DPN specifies the connectivity information for the Agent, supported Control Protocols and the DPN Groups
    it is a part of.</t>
    <t>DPN Groups specify the Mobility Role, supported access technologies and mobility profiles. It also specifies
    connected peer groups.</t>

        it using CONFIG_BUNDLES with the first operation being the entities to be copied and
        a second operation with the Cloning instructions. A CLONE operation takes two arguments,

  Rather than creating a specific command for assigning the IP a bit position in a
  COMMAND_SET is reserved for Agent based IP assignment. Alternatively, an entity

   As depicted in <xref target="fig_port"/>, the port represents the anchor
   of rules through the policy-group, policy, rule heirarchy.  A
   Client and Agent use the identifier of the associated policy to directly
   access the rule and perform modifications of traffic descriptors or action
   references.  A Client and Agent use the identifiers to access the descriptors
   or action to perform modifications. From the viewpoint of packet processing,
   arriving packets are matched against traffic descriptors and processed according
   to the treatment actions specified in the list of properties associated with the
   port.

<t>
   As depicted in <xref target="fig_context"/>, the context represents a mobiility
   session heirarchy.  A Client and Agent directly assigns values such as dowlink
   traffic descriptors, QoS information, etc.  A Client and Agent use the context
   identifiers to access the descriptors, qos information, etc. to perform modifications.
   From the viewpoint of packet processing, arriving packets are matched against traffic
   descriptors and processed according to the qos or other mobility profile related actions
   specified in the context's properties. If present, the final action is to use a context's
   tunnel information to encapsulate and forward the packet.
  </t>
<t>A second context also references context1 in the figure.  Based upon the techology a property
  in a parent context MAY be inherited by its descendants.  This permits concise over the wire
  representation.  When a Client deletes a parent context all children are also deleted.</t>

  <t>Actions defines how to apply action to classified traffic flow by descriptors,

    given bandwidth, and connectivity management actions, such as pass, drop,

  <section anchor="protoop_m1" title="Protocol Operation">

<t>The following list comprises a more detailed description of each message's semantic.</t>

<t>An FPC Client and Agent MUST identify themself using the CLI_ID and AGT_ID respectively to ensure that for all
transactions a recipient of an FPC message can unambiguously identify the sender of the FPC message.
<!--All messages between an Agent and a Client must identify the Client and Agent using the CLI_ID and AGT_ID respectively.-->
A Client MAY direct the Agent to enforce a rule in a particular DPN by including a DPN_ID value. Otherwise the Agent
selects a suitable DPN to enforce a rule and notifies the Client about the selected DPN using the DPN_ID.</t>


<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>PRT_ADD - Issued by a Client to add a new logical port at an Agent. An Agent receiving the
   PRT_ADD message identifies the new port according to the included port identifier (PRT_ID).
   <!-- In case the DPN holds already a registration for a logical port with the same identifier, the Agent should throw an
   error message to the Client. Otherwise the --> The Agent adds a new port into its conceptual data structures using the
   port identifier as key. Optionally, the PRT_ADD message MAY include properties as well as traffic descriptors,
   which are bound and refer to the new port. This enables a Client to issue a new configuration in a single transaction
   with an Agent. A Client MAY assign a port to a group of ports and indicate the associated port group identifier (PRT_GROUP_ID)
   in the PRT_ADD message.</t>
<t>PRT_DEL - Used by a Client to delete a port. An Agent receiving such message MUST delete all properties
   associated with the identified port.</t>
<t>PROP_ADD - Used by the Client to add a new property to an existing port. The property is unambiguously identified
   through a property identifier (PRT_PROP_ID). All traffic, which is directed to this port is treated according to
   the existing and newly added property. Optionally, the PROP_ADD message can include traffic descriptors, which refer
   to the port to which the properties are bound. This enables a Client to add new rules to the existing port to which
   the new properties have been bound in a single transaction.</t>
<t>PROP_MOD - Used by a Client to modify an existing property. For example, a tunnel property can be changed to direct
   traffic to a different tunnel endpoint in case of a mobile node's handover. Optionally, the PROP_MOD message can include rules
   descriptions, which refer to the port whose properties are modified. This enables a Client to add new rules to the existing
   port whose properties have been modified in a single transaction.</t>
<t>PROP_DEL - Used by a Client to delete one or multiple properties, each being identified by a property identifier. </t>
<t>TD_ADD - Used by a Client to add a traffic descriptor to a port. The traffic descriptor SHOULD unambiguously
   identify aggregated traffic (longest prefix), per host IP traffic or per-flow traffic in the TD_ADD command and
   bind the identified traffic to a port. Traffic descriptors are carried in a TD_CONTAINER, which allows the
   identification of a traffic description as well as the indication if a traffic handling priority in case the sole
   traffic description does not suffice unambiguous traffic matching. An Agent receiving a TD_ADD command MUST add the
   traffic descriptor to its local conceptual data structures and apply commands for local configuration to add the
   new traffic descriptor to the rule on the DPN. Multiple traffic descriptors can bind to the same port.
   All traffic captured by the traffic descriptor will experience the same treatment per the properties
   which bind to that port.</t>
<t>TD_MOD - Used by a Client to modify an existing traffic descriptor. An Agent receiving such messages MUST apply commands
   to the local configuration and update the rule on the DPN accordingly.</t>
<t>TD_DEL - Used to remove an existing traffic descriptor from a port. The Agent receiving such messages MUST delete
   the identified traffic descriptor from the local configuration and update the rule on the DPN accordingly.</t>
<t>MONITOR_REG - Used by a Client to install a monitor at an Agent. A monitor contains the monitor id, attribute to monitor,
   and optional reporting configuration. The attribute may be any ID with the exception of MONITOR_ID and EVENT_TYPE_ID.
   When a Monitor registration is applied, the reporting configuration MUST be applicable to the attribute monitored, e.g. a
   Monitor using a Threshold configuration cannot be applied to a Port but it can be applied to a numeric Port Property.

   Four report types are defined:
   (1) Periodic reporting specifies an interval by which a NOTIFY is sent to the Client,
   (2) Event reporting specifies a list of EVENT_TYPE_IDs that, if they occur and are related to the monitored attribute,
       will result in sending a NOTIFY to the Client,
   (3) Scheduled reporting specifies the time (in seconds since Jan 1, 1970) when a NOTIFY for the monitor should be sent to the Client.
   Once this Monitor's NOTIFY is completed the Monitor is automatically de-registered,
   (4) Threshold reporting specifies one or both of a low and high threshold. When these values are crossed a corresponding NOTIFY is sent to the Client.

   All monitored data can be requested by the Client at any time using the PROBE message. Thus, reporting configuration is optional
   and when not present only PROBE messages may be used for monitoring.
   If a SCHEDULED or PERIODIC configuration is provided during registration with the time related value (time or period respectively) of 0
   a NOTIFY is immediately sent and the monitor is immediately de-registered. This method should when a MONITOR has not been installed,
   an immediate NOTIFY is sufficient for the Client's needs and the Client has no further need for the monitor to be registered.
   An Agent may reject a registration if it or the DPN has insufficient resources.</t>
<t>MONITOR_DEREG - Used by a Client to remove a monitor from an Agent. The message identifies one or multiple monitors by including
   the MONITOR_ID. The message also includes an optional Boolean value that, when true, will result in NOTIFY messages being sent for
   the MONITOR_ID to the Client.
   When a monitor has a reporting configuration of SCHEDULED it is automatically de-registered after the NOTIFY occurs.
   An Agent or DPN may temporarily suspend monitoring if insufficient resources exist.  In such a case the Agent MUST notify the Client.
</t>
<t>PROBE - Used by a Client to retrieve information about a previously installed monitor. The PROBE message SHOULD
   identify one or more monitors by means of including the associated monitor identifier. An Agent receiving a PROBE
   message SHOULD send the requested information in a single or multiple NOTIFY messages.</t>
<t>NOTIFY - Used by an Agent to report the status of a monitor to a Client. This message contains the MONITOR_ID, a
   NOTIFICATION_ID to permit the Client to distinguish amongst many monitoring related requests, a TRIGGER that caused
   the NOTIFY message, the timestamp of when the monitored information was record for the message along with the value
   of the monitored attribute.</t>
<t>QUERY - Used by an Agent to request an update of port properties via a Client. The Agent adds one or multiple port identifiers
   to the QUERY message to request all properties associated with the identified port(s). The Agent MAY request the update of
   particular properties associated with a port by including the property and its identifier. As result of processing a
   QUERY message, the Client sends one or multiple PROP_MOD messages with the requested properties to the Agent.</t>
</list></t>

<t>All messages sent from a Client to an Agent MUST be acknowledged by the Agent. The response must
include all attributes as well as status information, which indicates the result of processing the message,
using the RESULT property. In case the processing of the message results in a failure, the Agent sets
the RESULT accordingly and MAY clear the property or traffic descriptor, which caused the failure,
in the response.</t>

<t>A Client MAY add a property to a port without providing all required details of the attribute's value. In such case
the Agent SHOULD determine the missing details and provide the completed property description back to the Client.
In case the Agent cannot determine the missing value of an attribute's value per the Client's request, it leaves the
attribute's value cleared in the response and sets the RESULT to failure. As example, the Control-Plane needs to setup
a tunnel configuration in the Data-Plane but has to rely on the Agent to determine the tunnel endpoint which is
associated with the DPN that enforces the rule. The Client adds the tunnel property attribute to the FPC message and
clears the value of the attribute (e.g. IP address of the local tunnel endpoint). The Agent determines the tunnel
endpoint and includes the completed tunnel property in its response to the Client.</t>


<t>The following list provides information on the use and semantics of attributes for traffic treatment:</t>


<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>PROP_TUN - Defines the properties for encapsulation into different tunnel headers. The property includes IP address
   information of tunnel endpoints as well as a type identifier specifying the encapsulation type. Further attributes
   may be included to provide information which is relevant for the configuration and initialization of the tunnel.</t>
<t>PROP_REWR - Defines the properties for IP address and port re-write.</t>
<t>PROP_QOS - Defines the QoS properties in terms of a known index type, e.g. LTE's Quality Class Index (QCI), and its value
   (QCI 1..9), as well as a Differentiated Services Code Point (DSCP) to classify and mark packets. Additional QoS attributes may
   follow, to define Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Maximum Bit Rate (MBR) bounds. PROP_QOS_GBR and PROP_QOS_MBR attributes can
   apply to a single port or multiple ports. The latter is required to configure aggregate bounds, such as Aggregate Maximum
   Bit Rate (AMBR), taking traffic, which is forwarded through different ports (hence experiencing different treatment),
   into account. In such case the GBR/MBR attributes append multiple PRT_ID attributes to identify the ports which are
   to be monitored to determine the aggregated view of the bit rate. As alternative to binding a PROP_QOS_MBR property to
   each port whose traffic is to be taken into account for Aggregate Maximum Bitrate (AMBR) metering, a Client can create
   a separate port with a single PROP_QOS_MBR property. Other ports, whose traffic is to be metered per the AMBR, can refer
   to the port with the PROP_QOS_MBR property using the PROP_CONCAT property. The scope of attributes for QoS is aligned
   to <xref target="RFC7222"></xref>. The Allocation and Retention Priority (ARP) as per <xref target="RFC7222"></xref>
   is not present in the list of QoS-specific attributes, since ARP is treated and kept in the Control-Plane for granting
   requests for new resources and QoS, as well as for preempting other QoS configuration, if needed.</t>
<t>PROP_QOS_GBR - Defines the GBR bound for traffic associated with a port.</t>
<t>PROP_QOS_MBR - Defines the MBR bound for traffic associated with a port.</t>
<t>PROP_GW - Defines a Next Hop IP address, to which packets are forwarded. Using this attribute, the Control-Plane can
   configure a host-route in the Data-Plane to deviate from default routes.</t>
<t>PROP_CPY_FORW - Refers to a different port and results in treatment of a copy of packets per the properties
   bound to the referred port.</t>
<t>PROP_DROP - Defines a treatment action to drop packets of traffic associated with a port. As example, this treatment
   action can be used to enforce gating rules and filter traffic which does not match any traffic descriptor.</t>
<t>PROP_CONCAT - Traffic can be treated per properties bound to concatenated ports. After treatment of traffic
   according to the properties of a port, additional treatment actions per the properties bound to a separate port,
   which is referred to in the PROP_CONCAT property, apply to the traffic. As example, port concatenation can be used
   to enable AMBR metering to traffic which is associated with multiple other ports.</t>
<t>PROP_NSH - Defines the properties for a Network Service Header (NSH). The header is included to the classified IP flows.</t>
</list></t>

<!-- Note: Is this the right place? -->
<t>Unlike descriptors, overlapping or contradictory properties cannot be resolved by the Agent. For example, adding
address translation related properties and a Drop property to a single port may result in needless activity in the DPN
or it may reflect a temporary administrative activity where the port must Drop traffic. Other properties may be intentionally
set, e.g. a property that invokes and accounting activity and a Drop property present on the same port.
The FPC Client MUST avoid situations where contradictory properties or those that result in unnecessary activity are added
to ports. Rather, in such situations, multiple ports MUST be used. In some obvious cases the Agent MAY raise a warning
but a contradictory action.</t>
<!-- Warning, how?-->

<t>The following list provides information on the use and semantics of administrative properties:</t>

<t>
<list style="symbols">
<t>ADMIN_STATE - A Client can apply an administrative state to a port indicating the desired operational status of a port
   (enabled, disabled, virtual). An Agent, which receives a message without ADMIN_STATE property, SHOULD consider the
   port to be 'enabled'.</t>
<t>SESSION_STATE - A Client can indicate to the Agent the status of a rule to serve Data-Plane traffic. A session state
   'complete' confirms that a rule is valid and ready to serve Data-Plane traffic. A session state 'incomplete' hints to the Agent
   that more FPC message will arrive from the Client to complete a rule, whereas session state 'outdated' requires the Agent
   to solicit an update of the rule from the Client in case a rule with session state 'complete' is desired. An Agent, which receives
   a message without SESSION_STATE property, SHOULD assume the session state is 'complete'.</t>
<t>CLONE_REF - Instead of repeatedly sending all properties and traffic descriptors for similar rules, a Client
   can take a clone of a previously configured rule as base for a new one by using the CLONE_REF property with a PRT_ADD message
   and refer to an existing port. The cloned port will be a copy of the referred port and serve as base for the new port.
   The cloned port will have its own port identifier, which will also be present in the port identifier portion of the property
   identifiers. After a cloned port has been created, it represents its own rule without any further dependency on the reference
   port which served as source to create the clone. A Client MAY apply updates to existing properties of the new port, as well
   as delete or add properties. Updates to the port in terms of new or changed properties and traffic descriptors MAY
   already come with the PRT_ADD message or subsequently using messages to handle properties and traffic descriptors.
   A Client can use the CLONE_REF property with messages to handle properties and traffic descriptors to achieve a different result.
   In such case these messages identify an existing port already and processing the CLONE_REF property on the receiving Agent will result
   in a reset of the identified port to match the properties of the port referred to in the CLONE_REF property.</t>
<t>ACT_DELAY - A Client can use this property to define a delay in ms before an updated rule takes effect at an Agent,
   e.g. an administrative state 'enabled' will be enforced by the Agent after the delay per the Client's request.</t>
<t>PRT_BIDIR - A Client uses this property to indicate to an Agent to apply a rule associated with a port bi-directionally.
   In case the PRT_BIDIR property is absent in a message, the Agent assumes a rule applies uni-directionally.</t>
<t>RESULT - An Agent uses this property to signal to the Client in a response the result of processing a message.</t>

<t><xref target="fig_msc_example"></xref> illustrates an exemplary session life-cycle based on
Proxy Mobile IPv6 registration via MAG Control-Plane function 1
(MAG-C1) and handover to MAG Control-Plane function 2 (MAG-C2). Edge DPN1 represents the Proxy CoA after
attachment, whereas Edge DPN2 serves as Proxy CoA after handover. As exemplary architecture,
the FPC Agent and the network control function are assumed to be co-located with the Anchor-DPN, e.g. a Router.

<t>After reception of the Proxy Binding Update (PBU) at the LMA Control-Plane function (LMA_C), the
LMA-C selects a suitable DPN, which serves as Data-Plane anchor to the mobile node's (MN) traffic. The LMA-C
adds a new logical port to the DPN to treat the MN's traffic (1) and includes a Port Identifier (PRT_ID)
to the PRT_ADD command. The LMA-C identifies the selected Anchor DPN by including the associated DPN identifier.
</t>

<t>Subsequently, the LMA-C adds properties to the new port. One property is added (2) to specify the
forwarding tunnel type and endpoints (Anchor DPN, Edge DPN1). Another property is added (3) to specify the QoS
differentiation, which the MN's traffic should experience. At reception of the properties, the FPC Agent
utilizes local configuration commands to create the tunnel (tun1) as well as the traffic control (tc)
to enable QoS differentiation. After configuration of port properties have been completed, the LMA binds the
traffic description for the MN's traffic to the port by sending a TS_CONTAINER to the Agent and identifying the
MN's Nome Network Prefix (HNP) in the traffic descriptor. At the reception of the traffic descriptor, the Agent
applies a new route to forward all traffic destined to the MN's HNP to the configured tunnel interface (tun1).</t>

<t>During handover, the LMA-C receives an updating PBU from the handover target MAG-C2. The PBU refers to a
new Data-Plane node (Edge DPN2) to represent the new tunnel endpoint. The LMA-C sends a PROP_MOD message (5)
to the Agent to modify the existing tunnel property of the existing port and to update the tunnel endpoint
from Edge DPN1 to Edge DPN2. Upon reception of the PROP_MOD message, the Agent applies updated tunnel property
to the local configuration.</t>

<t>To reduce the number of protocol handshakes between the LMA-C and the DPN, the LMA-C can
append properties (PROP_TUN, PROP_QOS) and traffic descriptor attributes to the PRT_ADD message,
as illustrated in <xref target="fig_msc_aggr_example"></xref>.</t>

<section title="Security Considerations">

<t>Detailed protocol implementations for DMM Forwarding Policy Configuration must ensure integrity
of the information exchanged between an FPC Client and an FPC Agent. Required Security Associations
may be derived from co-located functions, which utilize the FPC Client and FPC Agent respectively.
</t>

</section>


<section anchor="IANA" title="IANA Considerations">

<t>This document provides a data model and protocol operation for DMM Forwarding Policy Configuration.
YANG models are currently included in the Appendix and will be updated per the next revision of this document
to specify the data model as well as to enable an implementation of the FPC protocol using RPC.</t>

<t>No actions from IANA are required. In case the semantics of this specification will be mapped
to a particular wire protocol, authors of an associated separate document will approach IANA for
the associated action to create a registry or add registry entries.
</t>

<!--
<t>
Detailed protocol specifications for DMM Forwarding Policy Configuration will follow the information
model as per this document and can be based on, for example, ReST-like or binary protocol formats.
Such protocol-specific details will be described in separate documents and may require IANA actions.
